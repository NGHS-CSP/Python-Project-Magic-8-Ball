# Python Project

Click on all of the jupyter notebooks that are in this repository. These all represent different challenges for you to work on during the course of our unit in python. To complete your project, it is very likely that you will need to learn and explore new things beyond what we learned in class. This is a common experience in coding and the internet/your peers will be instrumental to helping you achieve your goals. While you can use the internet for resources, parts of code, and help debugging, I do not want you to just copy and paste the solution to your problem from some other source on the internet. It is ok and even encouraged to use parts of code (just be sure to cite the source in a comment by the code) that you found on the internet, but the learning and growth that will come from this process will be severely dampened if you just take the solution from somewhere else.


Questions

1.“Describe the incremental and iterative development process you used, focusing on two distinct points in that process. Describe the difficulties and/or opportunities you encountered and how they were resolved or incorporated.” (Adapted from Create Performance Task Part 2b.)

During my project, I encountered many points in time where i was stuck or struggling with the coding process. One point specifically was when i was trying to create my thinking funciton. I didn't know how to make the outputs dissapear each time.
How I solved this problem by asking Annallee. She said there was a import called clear out_put that does what i needed. I used is several times in that think function, helping me make my outputs dissapear.
Another time that i was struggling with making my code run was when my random.randit generator was not working. I struggled for a while trying to figure out what was wrong with my code, than I decided to look for any
punctuation errors in my code. I discovered that I had forgotten a colon after an elif statement and the error wasn't showing for that line but the line below it.
I fixed it and my code worked then.




2. Describe how you used abstraction to reduce the complexity of the code.

I created a function in my code. This fucntion was called "think". What think did was print thinking..., clear output, wait for a second, then print thinking 2 more times with
time in between. This function was incrediablbly useful with the complexity of my code because I had to use this for each of my 20 outputs. It would have took me a long time if I had typed those lines of code for each one instead
of calling function. 




3. Explain your documentation strategy. In your explanation of your documentation strategy please refer to at least 2 different instances of good documentation in your program.

My documentation strategy was very simple. I pretty much described the different lines of code. If lines duplicated, I would just describe the section insstead of describi the individual lines. 
My first good line of documentation was when I describe the import clear_output. I just said that this import will clear the text box outputs.
The second good line of documentation was when I described the think function. I said that the think function displays thinking until it has the answer.
Then I commented and said that this is the only function i have in my code but I use it 20 times, so it is pretty important.
